I’m a product-minded Mobile App Developer with 4+ years of hands-on experience building, scaling, and shipping cross-platform apps using Flutter and modern JavaScript frameworks. From launching MVPs at early-stage startups to maintaining production-ready apps for thousands of users, I’ve led projects end-to-end—writing clean, testable code, integrating complex APIs, and collaborating closely with product, design, and backend teams. My journey began with curiosity and self-learning, evolved through real-world problem solving, and is now rooted in creating smooth, high-impact user experiences that feel effortless. Whether it’s building fast, intuitive UIs or tackling edge cases in production, I care deeply about performance, ownership, and solving the right problems. Let’s build something meaningful.
I bring 4+ years of experience in mobile App and web development, primarily using Flutter. I’ve led and delivered multiple production apps across Android and iOS - from architecture, clean UI/UX implementation, third-party services and Firebase integration to API handling, State management (Bloc, Riverpod, Provider), CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), analytics, and App Store releases.

I also have hands-on experience in React, Remix.js, TypeScript, backend integrations, and deploying features in agile, cross-functional teams. My focus has always been building scalable, secure, and maintainable applications while mentoring junior developers and driving code quality across the board.
With over 4 years of hands-on experience building and scaling production-grade Flutter applications, I’ve led end-to-end development across architecture, performance optimization, modular state management (BLoC, Riverpod, Provider), API integrations, and CI/CD workflows. I’ve shipped robust features and products across iOS, Android, and web platforms, often owning initiatives independently in fast-paced startup environments. 

The chance to build something impactful from 10→100 at a high-growth AI company deeply excites me. I’d love to bring my experience and energy to your team.
